# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
This project adds the weather description to the weather data retrieved from OpenWeatherMap API. 
Beta testers will use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. 
Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, via an embeded map, show the travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
